# Contributors Guide

Welcome to our project! We're thrilled to have you onboard and look forward to your contributions. To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we've outlined our development workflow, communication channels, and code quality practices. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these guidelines.

## Development Workflow

### Working with Linear

- **Ticket Assignment**: All tasks are managed through Linear. Ensure you're assigned a ticket before you begin work.
- **Branch Naming**: When starting work on a ticket, create a new branch in the repository. The branch name must correspond to the name Linear generates for the ticket. This consistency helps in tracking work and linking code changes to specific tasks.

### GitHub Practices

- **Draft Pull Requests**: As soon as you start working on a ticket, create a draft pull request (PR) on GitHub. This PR should point from your working branch to the main branch.
- **Regular Commits**: Push your code regularly throughout the day. This practice not only backs up your work but also keeps the team updated on your progress.
- **PR Reviews**: We encourage peer reviews of PRs. Take the time to review others' work and provide constructive feedback. Similarly, be open to receiving suggestions on your contributions.

## Communication

- **Asynchronous First**: We prioritize asynchronous communication to accommodate different work schedules. Use Linear, Notion, and GitHub for discussions, updates, and feedback on work.
- **Discord for Real-Time Chat**: For real-time communication, we use Discord. This platform is ideal for quick clarifications, immediate assistance, and team catch-ups.

## Code Quality and Practices

- **Pre-commit Checks**: We use pre-commit to ensure that our code adheres to our formatting standards and type checks. Make sure to run pre-commit locally before pushing your changes to avoid CI failures.
- **Code Review Process**: During PR reviews, focus on the readability, maintainability, and performance of the code. We strive for high-quality contributions that not only solve the problem at hand but also enhance the overall codebase.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Your Development Environment**: Follow the instructions in our `README.md` to set up your local development environment.
2. **Install Pre-commit**: Ensure you have pre-commit installed and configured. This tool plays a crucial role in maintaining our code quality.
3. **Join Our Discord**: Reach out to a team member to get an invite to our Discord server. This will be your go-to for real-time communication.

## Conclusion

Your contributions are valuable to us, and we're excited to see what we can achieve together. Remember, collaboration and communication are key to our success. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of our workflow, don't hesitate to ask on Discord or through the appropriate async channels.

Happy coding!

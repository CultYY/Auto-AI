The Home page should feature an eye-catching slider with my latest work, while the Portfolio page showcases my photography categories with interactive galleries. Additional requirements include a responsive design for mobile and tablet compatibility, integration of my social media feeds, and a simple contact form with fields for a visitor's name, email, and message. The site should also include smooth transitions and subtle animations for a polished look. I would like the website to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I expect it to be ready for launch within three weeks. Hosting and domain setup assistance is also required, as I want to ensure the website is live and functioning smoothly for visitors. Optionally, if you can provide basic SEO optimization, it would be a significant advantage. Please include a portfolio of your previous work when applying."

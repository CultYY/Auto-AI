It is essential for the system to be scalable, accommodating future expansions and increasing order volumes.\n\nKey Features:\n\nUser Roles: Two user types - Admin (with full control and ability to modify user roles and system settings) and a standard order management user (with abilities to delete orders, mark as complete, mark as shipped, etc.).\nOrder Management: Ability to add orders, view a list of orders on a dashboard in a clean format, and click on an order to see more details.\nOrder Actions: Options to mark orders as shipped, add notes, and other modular actions that can be expanded in the future.\nDatabase Management: The system should manage its own database effectively.\nDesign Requirements:\nOrder Queue: When an order is created it needs to be added to a queue.\n\nThe user interface should be clean, simple, and easy to navigate. A minimalistic approach with an emphasis on efficiency and ease of use is preferred.\n\nTechnical Requirements:\n\nProficiency in Flask is a must.\nExperience in building scalable web applications.\nStrong understanding of database management.\nAbility to create a user-friendly and responsive UI.\nProject Delivery:\n\nPlease provide an estimated timeline for completion along with your application. I am looking for someone who can start immediately and has a proven track record of delivering quality work on time.",

If a pattern is used, it should tile seamlessly.\nMitered Corners: Implement a function to create a mitered corner by joining the frame strips at 45 degrees. This function should handle the texture alignment at the corners.\nImage and Frame Assembly: Develop a process to assemble the matted image (if matting is applied) and frame components (strips and corners) into a final composition. Ensure that all elements are correctly aligned and sized.\nImage Handling: Include functionality to handle different image sizes and aspect ratios, adjusting the frame size accordingly.\nError Handling: Implement error handling for scenarios such as image loading failures or incorrect image dimensions.\nSupported Frames: support the frame types White, Black, Walnut (dark wood), Maple (light wood)\nSupported Sizes: support arbitrary sizes for the frame, artwork size, and matte size\nNotes: Frame width is uniform on all size.\nMat is always a solid color, from a provided RGB triple.\n\n# Link to Project\n\nSee examples at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKjYAD80bzY4iS6k1vvOtnwD1quyjjLJmetsO1tyrI4/edit\n",

When swiping, the adjacent video should move to the centre and auto-play and the other videos move back\n- There should be a slick animation on both web and mobile when the user swipes to view other videos\n- In production env, each video would come from a URL. \n- On mobile, the video section should occupy \"60%\" of the screen and the other sections would be under that.\n- On web, the video section should occupy \"40%\" of the screen and the other sections would be on the right of that.\n- On web, the video section should remain sticky on the screen when the user scrolls on the page. \n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/wmUsOfVTn5u8WcuXDVTYC6/Landing-page?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=jkQ1RS9mL4BTUEtW-1)\n\nI am happy to discuss any tradeoffs to this proposal if it significantly makes the implementation easier and quicker",

Examine the provided source code for both the Express and AWS Lambda receiver implementations.\n2. Diagnose and rectify the cause preventing the Slack modal from appearing with the ExpressReceiver.\n3. Guarantee that the Slack modal launches as anticipated when the Slack shortcut is activated.\n4. Ensure the working solution is fully compatible with Netlify Functions, considering the RedwoodJS framework and Slack BoltJS app integration.\n5. Thoroughly document any code modifications, detailing the troubleshooting process and the resolution for maintaining the codebase.\n\n# Technical Details\n\n- Compatibility with Netlify Functions is a must, and the implementation should continue using ExpressReceiver for Slack BoltJS.\n- The current setup is configured using a Slack Bot Token directly, but the reason it needs to work with ExpressReceiver is that we will use the oAuth flow and bolt docs say the AwsLambdaReceiver does not support it..\n- All Slack app interactions, including shortcuts, modals, and messaging, must perform correctly after the fix is implemented.\n- The solution should be maintainable within the RedwoodJS environment and aligned with best practices for Netlify-hosted applications.\n- Documentation of any additional dependencies or configuration changes needed for Netlify Functions is required.\n\n# Link to Project\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/betocmn/d26cf813961ac559f36bc890d3c249d4\n",

Etc..\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nSound should match our teachers voice and video should match his face. This means this should feel like the teacher did actually record a video for the user. The only part that needs to be customized is the name of the person. Everything else of the video can remain the same for everyone.\n\n## Technical Details\nUse whichever voice and deepfake tools you'd like, prioritizing for low cost solutions.\nVideo should integrate with activecampaign via API or N8N",

We're looking for a developer to build an API development extension that allows users to test REST and Graphql APIs. [Hoppscotch](https://docs.hoppscotch.io/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) are all great examples of the kind of tool we're looking for.\n\n**Extension features**:\n- An interface to define requests, including the URL, method, authorization, headers, and body\n- Make traditional HTTP requests or Graphql requests\n- Run a request and see the response (raw text and interactive JSON tree)\n- Save requests to edit or run them again later\n- Historical log of all requests that have been run\n- Replit theme support, with native-feeling Replit UI\n\nWe're open to additional feature ideas but the functionality above would be considered an MVP. Here are some other ideas we can tackle if there's time:\n- Multiplayer support so all users in a Repl can access the same saved requests\n- Graphql schema explorer\n- Environment variables integration via Repl Secrets, for reuse in requests\n\nOnce an application is accepted, we can chat about the scope in a bit more detail and I'll be available to answer questions or give feedback during the development process.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nMust deliver a feature-complete API tester written in React, using cURL for request execution, and fully themed with Replit-style UI elements.\n\n# Technical Details\n- The project should be written in React using our [React Extension template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-Extension?v=1). You will need to use our Extension APIs, which are documented [here](https://docs.replit.com/extensions/category/api-reference). We also maintain React hooks, documented [here](https://docs.replit.com/extensions/development/react/introduction).\n- Requests must be run via cURL to avoid CORS issues in the browser; this can be done via the exec API.\n- Theming should be handled via the Themes API. We don\u2019t have a first-class Replit component library yet, so you\u2019ll need to write the UI code yourself. We can provide a Figma library with Replit UI components to make the design process easier.\n- You\u2019ll need to persist user data to save requests and other information across reloads. This could be done initially with localstorage, but it\u2019s probably better to use ReplDB or a separate backend Repl. If a backend deployment is required for this project, Replit can sponsor the cost.\n- Once the project is finished, Replit will own the end-product and publish it as an official extension under the @Replit account.\n\n# Timelines / Milestones\n- **First Deadline: Nov 8, 2023** \u2014\u00a0The extension should be feature-complete.\n- **QA Period: Nov 8 \u2013\u00a0Nov 12, 2023** \u2014 We'll have one week to gather feedback and fix bugs.\n- **Final Deadline: Nov 13, 2023**",

It provides a snapshot of your overall financial health. To calculate it:\n\n* Monthly Cash Flow: This is the difference between your monthly income and monthly expenses. Positive cash flow indicates you're earning more than you're spending, while negative cash flow means you're spending more than you earn.\n\n* Savings Rate: This represents the percentage of your income that you're saving. It's essential for setting and reaching financial goals, especially long-term ones like retirement.\n\n* Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): This ratio provides insight into how much of your monthly income is used to pay off debt. It's particularly important if you're considering taking on more debt or if you want to see how manageable your current debt load is.\u2028\n\nTest suggestions (please do more than these!):\u2028\n- Do multiple tests where you authenticate, get the token, and then perform some Plaid api call successfully.\n- Store mocked responses for endpoints inside the project. This way, when computing some account reports, you can write unit tests to ensure calculation was correct.\n- Passing invalid requests to endpoints, edge case inputs (like invalid dates) and ensure errors are handled\n\nYou should shoot for as many tests as you can, At minimum, please create 15 tests.",

Some manual work can be done to make the script operational. \n\nBasically, this should be the high overview of the steps that should be taken from the script runners point of view:\n\n1. Create a new project in Retable (which is equal to Airtable bases)\n2. Specify Airtable key, base ID and Retable key\n3. Enter Airtable base name and corresponding Retable project name\n4. Run the script, importing tables, rows and columns of each table in Airtable base to the same named Retable project and tables.\n\nRetable API: https://docs.retable.io/retable-user-guide/retable-api/api\nAirtable API: https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nTo meet the requirements, the script should have the following features:\n\n1. Connect to Airtable API: The script should be able to connect to the Airtable API and authenticate the user. It should be able to access all the user's bases and tables.\n2. Extract all or specific bases: The script should provide the option to extract all the bases or a specific base, based on user input.\n3. The script should extract all views and tables in the selected Airtable base. If a view type is not available on Retable, it won't be generated.\n4. Extract attachments: The script should be able to extract all attachments from the Airtable base and store them in Retable project/table in their original format.\n5. Map Airtable column types Retable column types: The script should be able to map the Airtable column types (fields) to Retable column types. If Retable doesn't have a matching column type, it should default to rich text.\n6. Store data in Retable: The script should be able to store the extracted data in the Retable database in the same format and structure as the original Airtable base. \n\n# Technical Details\n\nExecution environment: The script can be executed locally.\n\nError handling: The script should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to the user if something goes wrong.\n\nDocumentation: The script should be well-documented, with clear instructions on how to use it.\n\nTesting: The script should be tested thoroughly, and all tests should pass before the script is accepted.\n\nWith these features, the JS file should be able to extract Airtable bases to Retable projects, including all views and attachments in their original state, making it easier for users to transfer their data between platforms. \n\n# Link to Project\n",

Read this real world story to help you understand the situation. The homeowner is Eric Clark https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/09/28/think-its-hard-someone-steal-your-home-think-again/ \n\nTo achieve the goals of communication, the affected homeowners must conduct thorough research to understand the problem, what they think is wrongful versus what legally constitutes wrongful foreclosure, and their needs from the consult .\n\nHowever, there are several  challenges and dependencies that  arise when clients  try to engage attorneys which may contain vague, imprecise or incomplete data. The clients may not provide all relevant information on the first all and the human attorneys may not ask all relevant questions on the first call. \n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nI would like to create WrongFul-Foreclosure Bot/co-pilot ( ForClo Bot) PoC\n\nForClo Bot would leverage natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to guide clients through the process of asking fact based questions. The chatbot would start by asking the homeowner/debtor a series of questions about the client's case, property information, lenders information and foreclosure sale related information. Based on the provided facts and responses, WF-Bot  would analyze the data and generate a customized legal research plan with actionable insights and recommendations for the attorney. Lets call the output \u201cDraft Legal Brief\u201d. Once the legal brief is complete, the attorney  could perform human review and approve it. The approved report is then sent to the client along with the attorney's thoughts on their case.  A sanitized or different version of the report can be sent to relevant authorities, if the client desires. \n\nIn real world - this PoC could be a Google Form with the 10 questions. User provides responses. Responses are cleaned up for language. The questions and responses are fed into ChatGPT ( Claude/BARD or anything you propose). A prompt is designed to \u201cidentify information gaps, inconsistencesies\u201d. Another prompt guides LLM to generate a report for the attorney with relevant questions they should ask the client or the bot can pose back to the user. All data needed for PoC is provided. The data is real case and the questions have been curated from courts. So this is not really dummy data. PoC will go into a law office. Looking to build a team. \n\n\n\n# Technical Details\nChat bot captures questions and answers to the given 10 questions, feed to ChatGPT, Generate report and additional research questions. \n\n\u2014\n\n\nSample PoC Questions\n\n1. Were you provided proper notice of the lender's intent to foreclose?\n   - Request copy of Notice of Intent to Foreclose\n   - Was it sent by registered/certified mail at least 30 days before the proposed foreclosure date?\n\n2. Did the foreclosure sale occur at the correct time and place as specified in the notice and advertising? \n   - Request copy of Notice of Sale\n   - Did the time/place match what was advertised?\n\n3. Was the Notice of Sale properly published in the county's legal organ?\n   - Request copy of published Notice of Sale\n   - Was it published in the correct newspaper and in accordance with statutory requirements?\n\n4. Did the published foreclosure advertisement contain any errors or omissions?\n   - Request copy of published advertisement\n   - Did it include all required info like property description, sale date/time, etc. per statute?\n\n5. Were proper bidding and auction procedures followed at the foreclosure sale?\n   - Request foreclosure sale procedures/minutes\n   - Did bidding process align with statutory requirements for sheriff's sales?\n\n6. Was the deed under power of sale properly recorded after the foreclosure auction?\n   - Request copy of recorded deed\n   - Were recording procedures followed and deed properly executed?\n\n7. Did the foreclosing party have legal standing to conduct the sale?\n   - Request copy of assignments of security deed\n   - Was the deed properly assigned to the foreclosing party?\n\n8.

Initially, the goal is to emulate the task demonstrated [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_research.ipynb).\n\n# Requirements\n- Craft the simplest chat GUI for user-friendliness, utilizing any suitable Python library.\n- Enable model selection between gpt3.5 turbo and gpt4 via the UI.\n- Ensure adherence to OpenAI API rate limits as per [this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits).\n- As the app approaches or hits the rate limits, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to ensure subsequent requests are spaced out over increasing intervals.\n- (optional) Provide clear user feedback within the GUI whenever the rate limits are close to being reached or have been exceeded, and when a retry is scheduled.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n- The app showcases a chat GUI.\n- Users can toggle between gpt3.5 and gpt4.\n- Rate limits adjust based on the selected model.\n- Compliance with OpenAI API rate limits is maintained.\n\n# API Key\nShould there be a need for the API key, advise on how to securely share it.\n\n# Test Scenarios\n## Scenario 1: GUI Functionality\n- Is there a visible indication of the active model?\n\n## Scenario 2: Rate Limit Adherence\n- Does the app handle rate limiting gracefully without crashing?\n- Are there clear error messages when rate limits are approached or exceeded?\n\n## Scenario 3: Sample Request Completion\n- Goal: Fetch the top-10 pivotal papers on Large Language Models applications from ArXiv, published within the last month. Criteria for 'importance' include:\n   1. Potential significant impact on a critical business process.\n   2. High applicability in real-world scenarios.\n   3. (Suggest any additional criteria to gauge 'importance'.)\n  \n- Output: Present your findings in a table format within a doc or excel sheet.\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "# Create a productivity-boosting Chrome extension that helps users track and complete specific tasks in a dedicated, easy-to-access text box and provides a witty feedback message upon task completion.\n\n# Core Features & Functionality:\n\n**Sticky Text Box:**\n\n**Location:** Sticks at the bottom where extensions are located on Chrome.\n**Appearance:** Dark-gray with white text.\n**Dimensions:** Small enough to write approx. 30 words in Arial 11 font, but expandable if required.\n\n**Behavior:**\nAppears upon clicking the extension icon and disappears with another click.\n**Task Entry:** Users should type in a specific task they are working on.\n**Task Completion:** Features a green check button (with a green check sign icon) that, when clicked, scratches out the completed task, displays a witty feedback message, and then empties the input text box.\n**History Log:** A small info button (with a corresponding icon) will display the last 10 completed tasks when clicked with the completion date.\n**Witty Feedback Message:** Upon task completion, users receive a witty feedback message generated by GPT-3.5.\n\n**Example Messages:** \"That's how you do it, dawg!\" or \"Keep the tasks flowing, and your hair glowing!\"\n\nThe message can fade out after a few seconds or disappear upon the next action.\n\n**Data Persistence:**\n**Task Persistence:** Tasks will not persist upon closing and reopening the browser.\nHistory Log: The log of the last 10 tasks should persist and be accessible via the info button.\n\n**Icon:** A flywheel will represent the extension on the Chrome toolbar.\n\n# Additional Information:\n**Data Storage:** We recommend using the browser storage API for ease of use and seamless integration. However, the freelancer may suggest other efficient methods.\n\n**Error Handling:** The freelancer should implement error-handling mechanisms to address potential issues like failed storage retrieval or writing. Recommendations are welcome.\n\n**Permissions:** The freelancer should advise on necessary permissions for the extension based on the finalized features and functionalities.\n\n# Deliverables:\nA working Chrome extension that matches the described features and functionalities.\nDocumentation on how to install, use, and troubleshoot the extension.\nRecommendations on data storage methods, error handling, and required permissions.\n\nWith this addition, the user not only tracks and completes tasks but also receives a light-hearted and engaging feedback message to keep them motivated. This adds a unique and enjoyable element to the user experience.\n\nFor this initial extension, we're looking at around $100 due to its simplicity. That said, if this goes well, we have - at least - four more extensions lined up to build. We can discuss a higher rate for those. ",

As we are preparing for a product demo next week, we need some additional functionalities and use-cases added. Here are the details:\n\n# Current Product Structure:\n\nBackend: Django\nDatabase: SQLite\nFrontend: React\nFrontend Hosting: Vercel, Free Tier\nBackend Hosting: Netlify\nIntegrations:\nCreditChek for Nigeria KYC\nTermii for messaging (SMS invite)\n\nUser Flow:\n1. Agent User Signs in.\n2. Agent clicks on invite.\n3. Enters Phone Number, Country, and National ID.\n4. Sends Invite link to the customer.\n5. Customer clicks on the link, which directs to a CreditChek widget.\n6. Customer submits results.\n7. CreditChek retrieves data and sends data to the Agent dashboard.\n8. Agent clicks on Submitted, clicks on customer row, and goes to the detail page to see risk metrics.\n\n# Required Enhancements for the MVP Demo:\n\n1. Integration with OneBrick for Indonesia KYC:\nUse the income verification, employment verification, and account balance verification functionalities of OneBrick. These are three different API calls which need to be made simultaneously and the data retrieved all at once.\n\n2/ Messaging Platform Integration for Indonesia:\n\n  Since Termii is Nigeria-specific, we need integration with a global messaging \n  platform (like Twilio) for the Indonesian users to receive the KYC link.\n  UI/UX Changes:\n\n3. Alter the logo and color scheme of the KYC link page to reflect the branding of the company we're doing the demo for.\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.  Functional code with the aforementioned enhancements.\n2. A brief testing report confirming that all new and old functionalities are working correctly.\n\n# Notes:\n1. Either rebuild, or understand current code and maintain while adding the new requirements. I don't care. Previous developer is available for one or two calls to help in case needed\n2. Project needs to be ready and tested for a demo by Wednesday Sep 20 GMT +3 Afternoon.",

Instead of icons to be \u201ceaten\u201d, Endeavor Snake displays pictures of Endeavor Staff\n2. When the user \u201ceats\u201d the Endeavor Staff, the side bar displays with a fun fact about that Staff. This will include name; office; tenure; ungoogleable fact\n3. The picture and Staff information should be uploadable via CSV\n4. There will be a leaderboard for the top 10 highest historical scores. The user will be prompted to enter their name for the leaderboard if their score is among the 10 highest.\n\nThe UI of the game should improve upon our MVP that is currently live at snake.endeavor.org. \n\nIf the bounty is completed to an adequate level, there is room for more development work.",

I don't want to have an email/password authentication flow.\n - Create a simple login page (CSS not required) with the three buttons to sign in with each of the third-party auth providers.\n\n### Payments\n - I want to sell three different tiered products for a one-time cost (no recurring monthly/yearly subscriptions).  Include how to configure and add more in the setup guide.\n - Users should be able to seamlessly switch upwards between tiered products. If I have currently paid for a tier 1 product for $10 and decide I want to upgrade to a tier 2 for $20, I should be charged an additional $20.  Users don't need to downgrade, and I'll handle refunds manually.\n - Users stored in the supabase DB should have an enumerated `plan` field I can check to see which tier they have purchased.\n - Purchasing a tier is part of the initial signup flow.  No free trial.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n - I want to see **what you've built** more than what you **say** you can build. Include the link to your personal best work in your bounty application.\n - Take the deadline seriously. If you exceed the deadline without notifying me in advance, the bounty will be cancelled.\n - Include your discord username in the bounty application\n\n## Get in touch\nI don't accept friend requests on discord very often.  If you share a mutual server, my DMs are always open.  Here are the instructions to get in touch with me once you've been accepted for the bounty:\n\n1. Join either [My discord server](https://connerow.dev/discord) or [Replit's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/replit)\n2. DM me (`ironcladdev`) something regarding the bounty\n3. I will respond shortly\n\n## Bonuses (optional - 1000 cycle tip each)\nFor each of the bonuses you complete, I will tip you an additional 1000 cycles\n\n - Twitter/X Oauth. I should be able to collect the user's email address along with all the other basic information such as user handle, ID, etc.  This was not required in the bounty initially since I'm not sure if you need to pay to use twitter's Oauth API.\n - Login Page. Use [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to make me a beautiful login page for the third-party auth providers.  The login page should look professional and use the tailwind `slate` palette.\n - Well-documented Typescript code with JSDoc.  If you document any functions/methods you create with JSDoc, I'd gladly tip you an additional 1000 cycles for a good developer experience.\n - Robust util functions/types.  Create some reusable functions for easily performing CRUD options on users, fetching plan data, and/or pre-built typescript types.\n - Setitngs page.  Users can edit their profile image, username/handle, and delete their account.  Doesn't have to be pretty, just has to work.",

These elements can be borrowed from existing sections of the website (blog), ensuring visual consistency.\n\nI'm looking to create new stylesheets for certain pages on my website. These stylesheets should differ from the ones used for blog posts, ensuring a distinct visual identity for these specific pages. Importantly, I'd like to avoid any unintended impacts on the styling of the blog posts themselves.\n\n(Originally, start the website with homepage, about, blog listing page, and a blog post. I've been using the about page template to create text based pages that live outside of the blog. So these should probably be broken out and organized accordingly.)\n\n\nTask 3)\nTackle the Google SEO canonical page errors alongside other rudimentary SEO tasks that have been highlighted through the Google Search Console.\n\nThe majority of the blog pages have been appropriately indexed; however, there's an issue with some recently created pages that haven't been indexed correctly. I suspect this might be due to something I've done on my end.\n\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Revise CSS on homepage and blog, ensure they match the previous design. It's just a few containers\n- Update stylesheets to support newly created pages (now. These should match the blog post styling, but as a new clas\n- Develop separate stylesheets for the designated pages, ensuring a unique look and feel compared to the blog posts.\n- Implement the styles in a way that they don't interfere with the existing styling of the blog posts. The goal is to maintain a consistent appearance across the rest of the website while achieving the desired differentiation on the specified pages.\n- Test the new stylesheets across various devices and browsers to ensure a seamless user experience.\n- Ensure these pages are structured properly and provide instructions on how I can create new pages\n- Resolve SEO issues, all pages should be indexed without errors\n- Answer Sitemap questions as needed\n\n\n# Technical Details\nhexo.io\nhttps://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap\nNetlify\nGitlab\n\nUsing notion kanban to manage tasks\n\n\n# Link to Project\nhttp://kenny.is\n\nNote, I have some additional work, landing pages, and design improvements once the task is complete if that is of any interest\n",

My background is in electrical engineering, I was once a programmer, but not anymore.  I would also accept a plain-English proof that the last part of what I'm asking isn't practical or possible. I'll wait a few days for replies before choosing somebody, assuming that anybody is interested and qualified. My goal would be to pay that person through later bounties to advance the project.\n\n# Technical Details\nI'm planning to do the work of chunking up my corpus and sending it to GPT 4 through command line prompts, I'm not going to turn over my files to somebody else, and I don't need an automated upload process, it will take me as long as it takes in my spare time, but I'll need to be shown the process. I'm not interested in studying python. I'm also entirely unsure about whether what I'm asking is practical or possible, but my preference for follow-up bounties would be to receive coaching on doing everything from the command line for the first to projects. I assume the third would require some programming.\n\n#Link to project\nI don't plan to host the project on Replit, I'd rather let GPT 4 bill me through the API key, or at least, I think that's how it can work. But I'm open to advice there as well.",

Although completion of the project is important, this is primarily a project I'm trying to work on to **learn**.\n\n### Project Summary\nThis project aims to develop a robust system that can generate Google Maps URLs for specified cities and locations of interest, fetch webpage content, emulate scrolling behavior for AJAX-loaded results, and parse this content for relevant business information. The data will be structured and stored in a MongoDB database, with efficient task management using Redis (or similar task-queue management system).\n\n### Key Aspects of the Project\n- **URL Generation and Storage**: Develop an API endpoint to dynamically generate or retrieve Google Maps URLs for given cities and locations of interest.\n- **Web Content Management**: Incorporate scrolling emulation for AJAX-loaded content to ensure comprehensive data collection from Google Maps.\n- **Data Parsing**: Extract key business details such as name, address, phone number, and website from the loaded web content.\n- **Structured Data Storage**: Utilize MongoDB for organized data storage, facilitating easy and dynamic data retrieval based on cities and locations of interest.\n- **Task Management**: Leverage Redis to manage tasks efficiently, ensuring optimal processing for the task of fetching, scrolling, and parsing URLs.\n- **Integration and Deployment**: Ensure seamless integration with MongoDB and compatibility with the Replit platform.\n- **Collaborative Learning**: Rather than simply delivering the code, the project emphasizes a collaborative approach, aiming to tutor the client through the development process.\n\n### Deliverables\n- Functioning API endpoints for URL generation/retrieval, and parsing.\n- A web content fetching system that can handle AJAX-loaded content.\n- A parsing tool to extract relevant business information from web content.\n- A MongoDB database system structured for dynamic database and collection creation.\n- Integration with Redis for efficient task management.\n- Detailed documentation for API testing and interaction using tools like Postman.\n- A finalized codebase written in Python, deployable on Replit.\n- Regular collaborative sessions for tutoring and code development.\n\n### Project Details\n- **Language & Tools**: The primary language for development will be Python. Additional tools and libraries will include MongoDB for database management, Redis for task queue management, and potentially others as required.\n- **Project Scope**: The project will cover the complete development lifecycle from understanding requirements, designing the system, coding, and testing.\n- **Collaborative Sessions**: Collaboration will be a cornerstone of this project. Scheduled sessions (~5 hours per week) will be organized to ensure the client is involved in the development process, offering opportunities for tutoring, feedback, and iterative development.\n- **Integration Requirements**: The system should seamlessly connect with MongoDB. Additionally, special attention will be given to ensure that the developed codebase is deployable and runs efficiently on Replit.\n- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation will be provided, especially focused on guiding users on how to test the API endpoint using tools like Postman. Best practices, potential pitfalls, and troubleshooting steps will be covered.",

The choice of technology will be left to the developer's expertise, but it should align with our existing website infrastructure. Current calculator uses .NET but the site is built on wordpress CMS.\n\nAdditionally, the standardized pricing data will be provided in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) and should be integrated into the calculator for real-time quote generation.\n\nTimelines / Milestones:\nWe understand the importance of efficient development, and we hope to have the pricing calculator ready for deployment within 7-15 days. We are open to discussing milestones and specific deadlines during the development process to ensure timely completion.\n\nWe are looking to something similar to : https://www.stanleysteemer.com/cleaning-quote-pricing#/select-services\n\nBONUS POINTS - Integrate live scheduling using booking software API\n",

Must be possible to integrate into WhatsApp Business Account and toggled on/off if/when needed.\n2. Low cost (can scale very well with calls).\n3. Doesn't respond in \"real-time\": needs to be human-like. \n4. Deploy on Supabase or AWS (if possible).\n5. Must be possible to train the agent -- and tell it when responses are good or not, over time.",

This can be done with a simple HTTP API, and will likely be the least technical part of this implementation.\n\nShould be efficient enough to process a large number of URLs, so it would be okay if it hosted the content on S3 and just sent back links for each URL, or gzipped the whole result (all the URLs and their contents). Whatever works best, just should be usable locally in a simple Python script.\n\n## Which AWS services to use?\n\nDoesn't matter, any. Just needs to work.\n\n# Questions you need to answer if you're applying:\n\nIs there anything in the plan you\u2019re unsure about? If so what are those thing(s), and how would you clarify your uncertainty?\n\nBe to the point in your application and in answering the question above.

        "description": "# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - Shipping Label Generator\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a web application on Replit.com that generates printable shipping labels for a webshop. The application will take input parameters from the (public) URL, generate a PDF output, and provide an editable form in a sidebar for real-time data modification.\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 URL Parameters\n\nThe application will accept the following parameters from the URL:\n\n- Recipient Name\n- Recipient Phone\n- Recipient Door Code\n- Customer Phone\n- Address\n- Message\n- Order Number\n- Customer Name\n- Product Name\n- Details\n- Shipping Method\n- Delivery Type\n- Customer Account (B2B or not)\n- Customer Account Company Name\n\n### 2.2 PDF Generation\n\nThe application will generate a printable PDF based on the input parameters. The PDF will be styled and structured similarly to the example provided.\n\n### 2.3 Editable Form\n\nThe application will provide an editable form in a left sidebar. The form will be preloaded with the input parameters. Users can edit the data and hit an \"Update Now\" button to update the PDF output on the right.\n\n### 2.4 Print Button\n\nThe application will provide a print button for the PDF output.\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n\nThe application should be user-friendly and intuitive. It should load quickly and perform smoothly. The design should be clean and professional.\n\n## 4. Technical Implementation\n\n### 4.1 Reusing HTML and CSS\n\nThe HTML and CSS code from the provided PHP page can be reused to style the PDF output of the new Replit app. This includes the structure of the label, the layout of the elements, and the styling such as fonts, spacing, and colors.\n\n### 4.2 Dynamic Content Generation\n\nThe dynamic content generation in the provided PHP page needs to be rewritten in a language supported by Replit, such as JavaScript. This includes the parts of the code that take the URL parameters and insert them into the appropriate places in the HTML.\n\n### 4.3 PDF Generation\n\nThe PDF generation can be done using a JavaScript library such as jsPDF or PDFKit. These libraries allow you to generate PDFs from HTML and CSS, which is perfect for this application.\n\n### 4.4 Form and Real-Time Updates\n\nThe form can be created using standard HTML form elements. The real-time updates can be implemented using JavaScript. When the user clicks the \"Update Now\" button, the JavaScript code will take the values from the form, update the URL parameters, and regenerate the PDF.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive description of the requirements for the Shipping Label Generator application. The next step is to start the development process, following the guidelines and requirements outlined in this document.\n\nExamples:\nhttps://www.panamy.ch/app/plugins/pltfrm-panamy-deliveries/inc/admin/print-label.php?print=1&recipient_name=Mara&recipient_phone=%2B41+76+717+21+97&recipient_door_code=&customer_phone=%2B13059799163&address=Mara+Dobbelfeld-Napoli%0D%0ARosenstrasse+31%0D%0A4410+Liestal&message=%3Cp%3EBebe%2C+good+luck+on+your%0D%0A%0Afirst+day%21+You+earned%0D%0A%0Athis+opportunity%2C+make%0D%0A%0Ait+count.+I%E2%80%99m+so+proud%21%0D%0A%0ATe+amo+siempre%2C%3C%2Fp%3E%0A&order_number=93484&customer_name=Denia+Napoli&product_name=L%27Adina&details=Regular&shipping_method=Standard&delivery_type=Postal&customer_account_is_b2b=0&customer_account_company_name=0\n\nhttps://www.panamy.ch/app/plugins/pltfrm-panamy-deliveries/inc/admin/print-label.php?print=1&recipient_name=Lauranie+Perrin&recipient_phone=%2B41+79+963+99+45&recipient_door_code=&customer_phone=%2B41792325613&address=Lauranie+Perrin%0D%0AChemin+malombr%C3%A9+5%0D%0A1206+Geneva&message=%3Cp%3EJoyeuse+Anniversaire%0D%0A%0ACh%C3%A8re+Lauranie%0D%0A%0AAvec+mes+meilleures%0D%0A%0Av%C5%93ux%0D%0A%0ASevda%3C%2Fp%3E%0A&order_number=93606&customer_name=Sevda+Hasanova&product_name=Il+Pellicano&details=Small+-+20+Roses&shipping_method=Express&delivery_type=Postal&customer_account_is_b2b=0&customer_account_company_name=0\n\nhttps://www.panamy.ch/app/plugins/pltfrm-panamy-deliveries/inc/admin/print-label.php?print=1&recipient_name=Renee+Auphan&recipient_phone=&recipient_door_code=&customer_phone=0763269997&address=Renee+Auphan%0D%0ALa+Molaz+4%0D%0A1164+Buchillon&message=%3Cp%3ECh%C3%A8re+Renee%0D%0A%0ANous+nous+r%C3%A9jouissons+beaucoup+de%0D%0A%0Apasser+cette+soir%C3%A9e+avec+vous%0D%0A%0Aet+vos+amis%0D%0A%0AMerci+beaucoup+pour+votre%3C%2Fp%3E%0A&order_number=93440&customer_name=Bianca+Janecek&product_name=Il+Corallo&details=Small+-+20+Roses&shipping_method=Express&delivery_type=Postal&customer_account_is_b2b=0&customer_account_company_name=0",

The interface will provide semantic similarity search capabilities by leveraging the stored embeddings. The chatbot will analyze user prompts, perform similarity searches on the embeddings, and generate high-quality, data-based responses tailored to the user's needs.\n\n## Task Breakout to Complete Project\n\n### Stage 1: Embedding Creation\nCreate an embedding ingestion workflow that can handle various file formats. Users can place items in a designated folder, and the script will process the unstructured data, generate embeddings, and store them in a SQLite3 database table. The database will include separate rows for the vectorized embedding data and an outline explaining the text the embeddings represent.\n\n### Stage 2: Load Embeddings into Vector Database\nLoad the embeddings created in Stage 1 into a vector database, primarily Pinecone. However, other options like Milvus can be considered based on developer input and their advantages for the project's requirements.\n\n### Stage 3: Semantic Similarity Search\nDevelop a user interface that utilizes OpenAI API Chat Completions or a similar chatbot framework. The interface will allow users to engage in conversation and seek assistance based on semantic similarity search. The chatbot will analyze user prompts, leverage the stored embeddings, and process the returned similarity search data. By combining the user's prompt, context, and the data from the embeddings, the chatbot will generate highly accurate and useful responses. This stage can be applied to various use cases, such as field service report assistance, where technicians can communicate their observations, receive accurate diagnoses, and efficient remedies.\n\n*I have working python chat completion chatbots in streamlit and flask that can serve as the jumping off point for the this UI (if helpful, not required - feel free to use your own etc.)*",

Sign up here: https://bolt.fun/tournaments/ai4all/overview and hop in the discord!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/T3C4YrAg2d\n\nHere's how you can apply:  \n1. Register your project for the hackathon that meets the bounty criteria\n2. Apply for a bounty with a link to your project.\n3. If your project is approved, you claim the bounty. \n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nFeel free to leverage and use existing frameworks and open source software. The MVP for this is described below, but you can go way further with it to improve your project for the hackathon submission. \n\n### MVP:\n1. Developer should be able to fork this repo / repl, run it with a command or by clicking the \u201cRun\u201d repl button, and have some interface (either inline like a copilot or externally like a chatbot) to a model, collection of models, or other AI enabled design specifically for programming Rust applications (bonus points if it\u2019s tailored for Rust Bitcoin focused development specifically!)\n\n### Some Additional Ideas you could implement to make an even cooler hackathon submission:\n\n1. Use rust\u2019s strong type system and error checking as inputs for the model! Rust\u2019s error messages are EXTREMELY useful as input prompts and refining LLM outputs. Try running the LLM code, feeding the error directly back into the model, then outputting the refined/corrected code based off the initial error messages.\n2. Mechanism for keeping the model / embeddings and other params up to date with new releases or tying the code to specific releases for commonly used Rust and Bitcoin versions.",

The program you create must generate a spreadsheet with however many rows of data as there are pictures uploaded. This means that the program must be able to handle processing 1000s of uploaded images & extracting their data. A brand new .csv or .xslx must be generated for each user upload. The program must have a user-friendly UI.\n\n# Program Requirements\n\n\u2022 ***MUST*** be able to run on a local application. I should not have to run this through Replit at all OR the internet, there should be a completely separate app/.exe that you created. I should simply be able to download, install, then run the .exe with no extra steps.\n\u2022 Program must be able to pick up on dashed lines, dots, & slashes, and extract them without errors\n\u2022 Program must always properly sort data into the correct columns, especially because some images are formatted differently\n\u2022 Must have a user-friendly UI. **I will tip 2000 Cycles if you create a UI that is similar to [this website's](https://almanac.io/).** Do not attempt to replicate this UI if you will not do a thorough job. For the 2000 Cycles, you must create a UI that is very close, similar in fonts & elements.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nThis project must be completed by Tuesday, July 25th. I cannot accept any extensions.\n\nPlease consistently update me on your progress to avoid any misunderstandings throughout the project.\n\nI unfortunately cannot compromise at all. The project must be completed exactly as I described. If this is not possible, please do not apply for this bounty.

The MVP  should be useful and describe what tools/frameworks you'll use, and you can outline any further work you think would be cool or useful beyond the mvp.\n\n## Implementation recommendations:\n1. The first pass for the agent should be to assess whether it can complete the task it was assigned or if it needs a human to do part of it.\n2. If the agent assesses it needs a human (look up or verify something the model is unsure of, get it some missing information, etc), the agent should post the task to a queue for a human to complete (you can make this a super simple interface just have it publish to a db that gets read to a basic frontend ) and await the response.\n3. The human completes the task for the agent and is paid some satoshis. (if you've never done lightning payments, jump in the discord and one of the mentors can help you!)\n4. The human input is used by the agent to complete the task.\n\nFeel free to extend the capabilities and complexity of the application for submission for the hackathon!",

User should be able to send a query against the semantic cache (use whatever you're comfortable with like redis or chroma). \n2. Query is embedded and used for semantic search over existing cache. If >99% similarity for query, resulting answer is directly returned.\n3. If <99% similarity, service returns a L402 payment required code with a bitcoin invoice for X satoshis (X/100,000,000th of a bitcoin) (again, happy to help with this just message in the discord and one of the bitcoiner devs can hop on)\n4. User pays the invoice and resubmits the query\n5. Query is passed into the language model, result is passed back to the user and the query:result is stored in the semantic cache.\n\n### Some More Ideas (Optional, but will be a cooler submission for the hackathon):\n1. Split payments: Let user A submit their lightning address to be stored with the query they paid for, and when their query gets used by another user B split the payment with the user A who originally paid for the query.\n2. Have the model generate 2 answers, send both back to the user, user selects the better answer in exchange for getting some of their satoshis back, only the better answer is cached (improving the semantic cache quality).",

But I am not deep enough into this, and just want a finished and working solution here in Replit.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Script code provided in a fully working Repl\n2. Script can \"read-in\" a large individual text (100k words) via (input.txt).\n3. Script queries the text using GPT-4 with several sequential prompts.\n4. Script delivers GPT-4 responses in a file (output_[timestamp].txt).\n\n# Technical Details\n\n1. I want to provide a text via a file input.txt , stored in my Repl.\n2. The script \"reads-in\" in the content in order to be queried via GPT-4 API.\n3. The script contains a list of prompts (around 10) with questions on the text. The prompts can be hard-coded in the script. They stay the same. So I don't need the option to make individual prompts for each script run.\n\nExample prompts: \n\"Summarize the text in 100 words.\"\n\"What are the 5 key points of this text. Please summarize in bullet point style.\"\n\"What target audience is this text for? Please list target-audieces in bullet points top-down by importance\".\n\n4. For each prompt, the script uses GPT-4 to query the content of the provided text.\n\n5. Script delivers the GPT-4 responses in one file (output_[timestamp].txt). Each response has a headline, that I can define along each prompt. E.g. if the prompt is \"Summarize the text in 100 words.\", I want to define \"Summary\" as the headline.\n\nPlease just let me know if you have any additional questions.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nP.S. If I should be fully of with the bounty for the scope of this project, please let me know. But I would hope there's some library off the shelf that just needs to be used and adapted.",

Essentially I want a very simple workflow that comprises all of the tools I need or at least cuts my time invested down,\n\nAlternatively if this cant be done, feel free to reach out to me if you want to create 1000 colouring books. \n",

Quick loading and optimized performance are essential.\n\nThe main features and functionality of the website include:\n\nPages: The website will include a landing page, a product view page, and a contact us page. All pages should have working backlinks, and the product catalog on the landing page should link to respective product entries on the product view page.\n\nSearch Filters: The landing page will have a search bar that allows users to search for products by name and description. It should provide instant and dynamic updates as the user types. Additionally, clicking on a product category should instantly filter products belonging to that category.\n\nSoftware Marketplace: The website will host a marketplace where users can browse, search, and purchase software. Each software listing will include details such as the software name, description, price, vendor name, and user ratings/reviews.\n\nFuture Agents Page: A unique page called \"Upcoming Agents\" will showcase upcoming software releases. Users can view these releases and sign up for the waitlist if interested.\n\nVendor Application: Vendors can apply to sell their software through a form on the website. The form will collect information such as the vendor's name, contact information, and software details.\n\nPayment Integration: The website will integrate with Stripe to enable secure payment processing. Users can make purchases using various payment methods supported by Stripe.\n\nCross-Device Compatibility: The website should be compatible with different devices and browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Android, and iOS. It should be fully dynamic and responsive to different screen sizes.\n\nInfinite Scrolling: Implement infinite scrolling on the website, which will scale as more software is added for sale. This feature should load additional content when the user clicks on \"Show More.\"\n\nEmail Sign Up: Provide an email sign-up flow for users interested in joining the waitlist. This allows the website to keep users informed about new software releases and updates.\n\nShopping Cart: Include a shopping cart feature that allows users to select multiple products and purchase them together. Recommendations for other agents will be presented during checkout.\n\nCalendly Integration: Embed a Calendly iframe to enable users to book meetings directly from the website.\n\nBlog: Create a fully functional blog where articles can be uploaded.\n\nSearch Functionality: Implement search functionality that indexes all the items listed in the store for easy product discovery.\n\nThe website should be delivered as a fully functional product with all the specified features and components. It should be hosted on the designated platform. The PRD also mentions future considerations for easy expansion and modification of the website by the client. The provided Figma design will serve as the starting point, but some adjustments may be needed to accommodate all the required features and ensure a user-friendly interface.\n\nThe project timeline is urgent (ASAP), and the PRD concludes by summarizing the main requirements and objectives of the software marketplace website.",

Another possible solution could be \"airfield\", or \"location\", which also makes sense given the segment. \n\nI already have the code to fetch images from Google or Unsplash, just need some help making an AI prompt for \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" that can do the described task accurately (gpt-4 is too expensive for my use case). I'm also open to other AI models or solutions, as long as the images are accurate and relevant, and cost isn't too high.\n\nYou only need to work on the JS code that generates the search query / downloads the images, I will provide support if needed on any other parts of the codebase.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n- State any previous experience working with AI  / GPT based projects.",

This can include personal details, employment history, educational background, and responses to standard queries such as needs for sponsorship, veteran or disability status, and more.\n\nGiven the repetitive and time-consuming nature of manual data entry, we seek to develop a Chrome extension, Autofill4JobApply, that simplifies the process. This extension should pull data automatically from a locally stored resume or similar data sources, then populate this information into online job application forms.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. The extension must be compatible with Chrome browser.\n2. It should be capable of parsing and filling out forms on a variety of websites, not limited to specific job application platforms.\n3. The extension should auto-fill both text fields (e.g., name, address, email, employment history) and selection fields (e.g., checkboxes, dropdown lists).\n4. User interactions should be minimized to basic navigations like \"continue\" or \"submit\", with no need for manual data entry.\n5. Users should be able to easily add and modify the local personal information file, and the changes should be correctly reflected in the auto-filled web forms.\n6. The extension should ensure the safety and privacy of user data.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe Chrome extension is expected to follow this workflow:\n\n1. Read User's Local Data: The extension should read and parse a locally stored file (e.g., in CSV, or JSON, or XML format) containing the user's personal and professional data.\n\n2. Page Analysis: The extension should analyze the current webpage to identify fillable fields and selectable options. The use of DOM parsing, possibly with XPath or CSS selectors, may be required.\n\n3. Data Mapping & Filling: The extension should map data from the local source to the identified fields and options on the page, then fill them in automatically. It may leverage techniques like machine learning or rules-based mapping for fields not easily identifiable.\n\n4. User Information Update: The extension should allow easy updates to the local file by the user, and correctly reflect these changes when filling out the forms.\n\n5. Data Security: The extension must not store, transmit, or share the user's personal data, respecting user privacy.\n\n6. Users only need to maintain a local information table (which could be in Excel/JSON/or other formats). When applying for jobs, they should be able to just click \"continue\" or \"next\" without having to manually fill in or select information.",

In this git submodule (which is a subproject of the RLQP solver), I want to be able to run `python scripts/train.py`: https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/rlqp_train/tree/09667498113f20632b67c18402f3f294003b90f9#example-training. Right now when I run it I get some import errors like here: https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/rlqp/issues/1\n\nIf you are able to get the code that is successfully training on the examples given by the authors of the repositories - I will consider it a win.

Therefore, experience with these models is crucial.\n\nEmail Server Development: The team should have experience in developing and managing email servers, as the \"ccMe\" module will function as an email server for synthetic personas.\n\nContextual Understanding: The team should have a solid understanding of contextual analysis and how to incorporate it into language model responses.\n\nPersona Management: Experience with creating and managing personas is highly desirable. The \"ccMe\" module needs to generate responses that are consistent with the persona's characteristics.\n\nOpen-Source Development: The project emphasizes the importance of open-source development. The team should be comfortable working in an open-source environment and contributing to the public codebase.\n\nEthics and Privacy: The team should adhere to ethical guidelines and respect user privacy. The system should avoid impersonating real individuals.\n\nAdditional Details\nThe prototype should be designed with scalability in mind, as the ultimate goal is to create a module capable of managing email responses for a large-scale synthetic social network. The prototype should be able to handle at least 10 personas to demonstrate its capabilities.\n\nDeliverables\nA working prototype of the \"ccMe\" module functioning as an email server for at least 10 synthetic personas.\nDocumentation detailing the architecture of the \"ccMe\" module, how it interprets emails and generates responses, and how to use the prototype.\nA report outlining the challenges faced during development, how they were addressed, and suggestions for future improvements.\nBackground Information\nFor more context, please refer to this early whitepaper: Strange Loop Synthasaizer. Please note that the \"ccMe\" module is described slightly differently in this document.",

An existing GitHub link with the base of the service is already available, so the task will primarily consist of cloning and possibly modifying the existing service.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe app must allow users to upload their profile pictures in commonly used formats (jpg, png, etc.)\nThe app should successfully convert the uploaded profile pictures into AI avatars.\nThe conversion process should be efficient, and the user should not experience any significant wait times.\nThe app should provide a downloadable link or option for the generated AI avatar.\nThe app should handle errors gracefully - for instance, if a user uploads an invalid file format, the app should notify the user rather than crashing or producing an unhelpful error message.\nThe cloned GitHub project should not contain any bugs or issues.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe technical solution will likely involve a few key components:\n\nFront-end: This will involve creating an interface for users to upload their profile pictures. This could be a web page using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, or if the app is meant to be mobile, a mobile app interface.\n\nBack-end: This is where the main logic of converting the profile pictures into AI avatars will reside. Depending on the existing GitHub project, this could involve using Machine Learning/Deep Learning libraries or other image processing techniques.\n\nHosting/Server: The app will need to be hosted somewhere. This could be on a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud, or possibly a server if the app is meant to be used internally.\n\nStorage: The profile pictures and generated AI avatars will need to be stored somewhere. This could be in a database or cloud storage service.\n\nError Handling and Validation: The back-end will also need to handle any potential errors and validate the files being uploaded by the users.\n\n# Timelines / Milestones\n\nGiven that the base of the service is already available on GitHub, the project might be completed according to the following rough timeline:\n\nWeek 1: Project setup, initial cloning of GitHub project, and familiarization with the codebase.\nWeek 2-3: Modification and/or addition of features to the cloned GitHub project (as necessary).\nWeek 4: Integration of front-end and back-end, error handling, and validation implementation.\nWeek 5: Thorough testing of the app, bug fixing, and final adjustments.\nWeek 6: Deployment of the app and final testing in the live environment.\nThis timeline assumes that work begins immediately and continues at a steady pace. Please note that this is a rough estimate and actual times may vary based on the complexity of the task and other unforeseen issues. We will aim to complete the project by the beginning of July as requested.",

My employee will then get this email and manually update our website.\n\nI do have a development background, but I haven't coded in a while and don't have the time to build this myself. But I can speak your language and provide clear instructions and success criteria. \n\nI'm assuming the stack to accomplish this task is python, BeautifulSoup, Postgres, a hash function to determine differences, and an email library to send the email. I'm interested to know if any of the new GPT capabilities can be used to make scraping a lot easier and potentially automate it? I'd be interested in automating adding new supplier websites to the program. It would be great to just add a URL and the system, and it starts working without a developer having to map out the site for scrapping. This would also help if the site DOM were to change as well. I'm not super concerned with this functionality for the 1.0 version of the app, but it can be discussed.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and I can't wait to get started! Thanks!\n\nAcceptance Criteria\nThe bounty is for a stable scrapper of one site that downloads and stores inventory to determine what has been added, removed, price changes, and any other informational change concerning that piece of inventory. These changes are then formatted into lists and sent in an email.  Hosting is preferred on Replit but if it is not the best platform, the developer agrees to set up in another appropriate environment. The developer agrees to ensure stability and fix any bugs for a period of 1 month after project goes live.",

Injection based on v3.0.0-alpha.0 release.\n\n# Technical Details\n1. The demo app: https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/tree/master/examples/demo-app\n2. The menu elements are in PureFeatureActionPanelFactory function.\n3. Node version: v14.21.3\n5. kepler.gl version: v3.0.0-alpha.0\n6. The geometry data is in JSON.stringify(selectedFeature.geometry), you can find it in PureFeatureActionPanelFactory\n7. For the development, you can hardcode the remote URL to https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sshirokov/6168839/raw/100bc5588c3fdd7a85fee47e64ce926a2b8b11af/markets.json, just append the polygon dynamically. \n\n# Other details\n1. Your implementation can be in a public repo, as long as the license not limiting commercial use.\n2. The validateUrl function in the demo app is wrong, but the fix is out of scope for this bounty. If you must call the validateUrl function in your implementation, you can hardcode it to return true.\n3. I assume you would have to use loadRemoteMap function in the demo app to load the remote URL, but I didn't verify that.\n",

        "description": "Hello,\n\nI am seeking a proficient developer to create an advanced web scraping and monitoring system. The primary target of this project is Snapshot (https://snapshot.org/), a decentralized voting platform where multiple organizations host voting proposals. \n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to facilitate real-time monitoring of multiple organization pages on Snapshot for new proposals and to receive instant notifications via Discord whenever a new proposal is added to any of these organizations. I will be providing a list of organizations to be monitored separately. However, it is crucial that the developed solution has the flexibility for easy addition and removal of organizations from the monitoring list.\n\nHere are the specific requirements in further detail:\n\n1. **Snapshot Scraper**: The developed solution should have the ability to connect to Snapshot's GraphQL endpoint or leverage Scrapy to scrape the organization pages on Snapshot. Given that Snapshot is a dynamic website, the spider might have to use utilities like Splash or Selenium to render JavaScript or identify the API used by the website to load data.\n\n2. **Proposal Monitoring**: The spider should have a mechanism to identify when a new proposal is added to any of the monitored organization pages. We will define what constitutes a \"new\" proposal at the inception of the project, ensuring there's no ambiguity during the execution phase.\n\n3. **Dynamic Organization List**: The monitoring solution should have a feature to allow the list of monitored organizations to be easily modified. This means the capability to flexibly add or remove organizations should be a part of the tool without the need to modify the core code of the spider.\n\n4. **Automated Spider**: The spider should be programmed to run autonomously at regular intervals. For this project, the desired frequency is every 10 minutes. This will ensure that we capture and analyze information as soon as it's available.\n\n5. **Discord Notifications**: Upon identifying a new proposal, the spider should be capable of sending a notification to a predefined Discord channel using Discord webhooks. This notification should include comprehensive details about the new proposal, such as the title, URL, and the organization it belongs to.\n\n6. **Deployment Guidance**: Part of the deliverables should include step-by-step guidance on how the script could be deployed and run continuously in different environments. This should cover a variety of deployment scenarios to ensure we have flexibility in how we use the solution.\n\nThe end deliverables for this project will include the complete, working Scrapy spider code, in addition to comprehensive instructions on how to set up, use, and modify the list of monitored organizations in the spider.\n\nI invite you to consider this project and am eagerly looking forward to your proposals. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest Regards,\nAra Borious",

The user's browsing history constitutes a rich archive of reading material. However, it is not straightforward to search this wealth of information, mainly because it is stored as URLs rather than the content of the webpages.\n\nThis bounty aims to develop a command-line JavaScript program to bridge this gap. The program will accept a Safari history SQLite database file ('History.db'), specifically the 'history_visits' table, as an input. It processes this input to deliver a structured output, effectively transforming URLs into a searchable cache of text content.\n\nThis program should utilize the Postlight Parser, an open-source JavaScript webpage parser hosted on GitHub, to parse the webpage content into Markdown format. The parser is specifically designed to extract the essential reading content of a webpage, which aligns perfectly with the goals of this project.\n\nThe output will be a JSON object which should include the following details for each unique URL in the history:\n\n- The timestamp(s) of each visit to the URL.\n- The device and browser from which the URL was visited\n- The parsed content of the URL, transformed into Markdown format using the Postlight Parser.\n- A simple status code indicating whether the content was successfully retrieved or if there was an error.\n\nThis program is not a one-off solution, but instead should be built with future-proofing in mind. I anticipate extending its capabilities to support history files from other browsers and devices and to accommodate different output types.\n\nThe status code field is deliberately underspecified at this time. I plan to run this on my own history and learn through experience what different types of failures to try to catch. For instance, Safari history includes the title of a given URL; I think that if the Postlight Parser sees a different title, that could indicate that the content has changed between my visit in history and my attempt to get a copy of the text. I also expect to run into authentication errors, and that is OK. The goal of this program is to record the content of the reading material that I browse to. I do not want to capture things like online banking sessions or checkout confirmation pages. I expect to learn over time how to catch these exceptions and maybe even make an exclusions list.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n- The program must be written in JavaScript.\n- The program must accept a Safari history SQLite database file as input, specifically parsing the 'history_visits' table.\n- The output must be a JSON object including the required elements (timestamps, source, parsed content in Markdown, status code) for each unique URL in the history.\n- The program should be designed to facilitate future support for history files from other browsers and devices and different output types.\n- The program must use the Postlight Parser for webpage content parsing.\n\n# Technical Details\n- The program should be developed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool.\n- The primary programming language for this project is JavaScript.\n- The program should parse the Safari history from a SQLite database ('History.db'), specifically focusing on the 'history_visits' table.\n- The Postlight Parser, an open-source JavaScript webpage parser, should be used to parse webpage content into Markdown.\n- The program should handle status codes with a primary focus on distinguishing between successful content retrieval and any form of error.\n- The program should be coded in a way that allows for easy expansion in terms of supporting new browser history files, new reading apps, and different output types.\n\n",

This data should be saved in a separate bucket for completed ones.\n\n6) Confidence Score Threshold: The OCR component should provide the flexibility to set a confidence score threshold, allowing customization based on model performance and evolving business requirements. Documents with confidence scores below the threshold should be flagged for human review of the output.\n\n7) Human Review Flagging: The solution should implement a mechanism to flag documents with low OCR confidence scores for further human review, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the extracted data and saved to a separate folder\n\n8) The solution should leverage GCP, AWS, or Azure's AI models to perform the task.\n\nBy addressing these requirements, the desired solution will automate the OCR process, accurately extract key value pairs from PDFs, save the data in a structured format, and facilitate an efficient human review for documents with low OCR confidence scores.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n1) The solution should monitor the designated folder for new PDF uploads and automatically initiate the OCR process for each uploaded document.\n\n2) The OCR component should accurately recognize and extract text from PDFs in multiple languages, including handwritten text, with a high degree of accuracy.\n\n3) The extracted text should be processed to identify key value pairs, mapping each value to its corresponding key on the form.\n\n4) The solution should save the extracted data in a structured format such as CSV, ensuring the integrity and usability of the information.\n\n5) The OCR component should provide the flexibility to adjust the confidence score threshold, allowing easy customization based on model performance and changing business needs.\n\n6) Documents with confidence scores below the set threshold should be flagged for human review, indicating the need for manual verification of the extracted data.\n\n7) The flagged documents and outputs should be easily accessible for human review, enabling efficient identification and correction of any inaccuracies or errors in the OCR output.\n\n8) The solution should provide a user-friendly interface or API for managing the OCR process, configuring settings, and accessing the extracted data and flagged documents.\n\n9) The OCR and data extraction process should be efficient and capable of handling a large volume of PDFs within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n10) The accuracy of the OCR and data extraction process should be regularly monitored and evaluated to ensure continuous improvement and reliability. I want to be able to see average confidence scores I am getting from the system.\n\n11) The solution should be well-documented, providing clear instructions on installation, configuration, and usage.\n\n12) Comprehensive testing should be conducted to validate the OCR accuracy, key value pair extraction, data storage, and flagging mechanism, ensuring the solution meets the desired objectives.",

        "description": "# Problem Description\n\nWe have an existing web app project that serves as an AI companion, powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo. The current version includes HTML and CSS files, but it lacks functionality. We need a developer to make the app fully functional by implementing the necessary JS code.\n\nThe main objective of the web app is to help users achieve their goals. It starts with a user input form where they can specify their goals and preferences. Based on their input, the app should generate a personalized goal achieving dashboard (the outline of the dashboard is in the HTML/CSS, but the contents of the dashboard should be personalized to the user) that provides relevant information, guidance, and tools to assist the user in their journey.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nTo successfully complete this bounty, the developer needs to accomplish the following tasks:\n\nImplement JavaScript functionality to handle user input from the form and process it effectively through GPT.\nUtilize the provided HTML and CSS code to integrate the JavaScript functionality seamlessly.\nCreate a dashboard page that dynamically displays the user's goals, progress, and any relevant information retrieved from the AI model.\nEnsure smooth navigation between pages by connecting the buttons and links appropriately. Clicking on a button should open the corresponding page.\nTest the web app thoroughly to ensure all features are working as expected.\nCreate a GitHub repository containing the final code, ensuring it is well-structured and easy to understand.\n\n# Technical Details\nThe existing web app code consists of HTML and CSS files that define the design and layout.\nThe developer will need to write JavaScript code to handle user input, generate dynamic content, and establish the necessary interactions.\nThe app should be deployed using Vercel for seamless hosting and accessibility.\nPlease communicate with me if you have any questions or require additional information to ensure successful implementation at selimerenefe@gmail.com",

Generally the UI interactions all need to be as smooth/nice/pleasant as the GPT Playground. Must have decent error handling, on par with the gpt playground.\n\nPerhaps flask or react, but I'm open to your suggestions.\n\nTo apply, include the link to 2 live sites that you personally built solo - whether for yourself or someone else.

The criteria for identifying \"new\" proposals will be clarified at the start of the project.\n\nDynamic List of Organizations: The solution should allow the list of monitored organizations to be easily modified. I should be able to flexibly add or remove organizations as needed, without needing to modify the core code of the spider.\n\nAutomate the Spider: The spider should run automatically at regular intervals - specifically every 10 minutes.\n\nDiscord Notifications: When the spider identifies a new proposal, it should send a notification to a specified Discord channel using Discord webhooks. The notification should include details of the new proposal, such as the title, URL, and the organization it belongs to.\n\nDeployment Advice: Provide guidance on how the script could be deployed and run continuously.\n\nThe deliverables for this project include the complete, working Scrapy spider code, as well as instructions on how to set up, use, and modify the list of monitored organizations in the spider.\n\nThank you for considering this project.

Using GPT 3.5/GPT 4 (or a similar alternative), the program analyzes the transcripts so that:\n- For each call, it summarizes what happened during the call and how the customer felt (customer sentiment: happy/neutral/negative). See reference here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/copilot/session-insights. This analysis is written in a single txt file (each summary includes the date of the call and the name of the agent). \n- After summarizing and analyzing the 60 calls, the program creates a general analysis (txt file is fine) surfacing which customer questions were more common in calls where the customer sentiment was not positive (i.e. \"In 35% of calls where the customer was not happy, the customer asked about travel logistics...\").\n\n# Technical Details\nI'd like:\n- To be able to run the program right from my Replit workspace (no need for a web-based UI).\n- For the program to use my Open AI API key.\n- To collaborate with the developer when writing the prompts needed to perform the analysis.\n- For the developer to teach me in a 1-hour call how he/she built the program, so I can learn how to build similar workflows in the future (I'm a non-technical product manager).",

I tapped the BTC button on the AAPL play and it added the Buy to Close play. It should hide the buttons for Assign and BTC from the original play and the Buy to Close play as shown with the black X\u2019s. Yet the NVDA play is unaffected. \n\nExample 2: In this example I have two AAPL plays in the list. I tapped the BTC button on the second AAPL play, the one with x2 and Strike of $150.00, and it added the Buy to Close play. It should hide the buttons for Assign and BTC from the original play and the Buy to Close play as shown with the black X\u2019s. Yet the first AAPL play is unaffected. \n\nIf this is confusing please ask any questions you may have and I can explain in further detail.

The results should update in real-time as constraints are added. There are several types of constraints:\n\n* Boolean constraints (eg results should meet this constraint)\n* Range constraints (eg results should be within some range)\n* Enum constraints (eg results can match none, one, or several of the following options)\n\nWe\u2019ll need UI for each of these constraint types.\n\nConstraints should be specified in the UI in a general-purpose and configurable way, so I can add other constraints later.\n\nThe actual filtering will be provided by a backend API. This project only relates to the frontend, so you\u2019ll need to be comfortable building against a fake API. We can discuss what the request / response format will look like, but there should be an abstraction layer between the frontend and backend to allow us to vary them independently.\n\nThe priority here is ease of use and speed: new filters should update the results quickly without any flickering. If the API is slow to return a response, we should come up with a nice UX to indicate that certain values are loading without blocking the UI for the user.\n\nThe UI should be written in React using TailwindCSS for styling.\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nIn your application please explain how you would implement this. Applications with basic prototypes or partial implementations will be given priority.\n\nYour solution should be written in TypeScript. Well documented and structured code is a must!\n\n",

TLDR: I am open to changes to how the generated data gets created function-wise, but the actual audio.html display should remain the same.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nTo ensure the success of this Replit Bounty, these acceptance criteria have been created:\n1. Whenever a new Horror Story is generated, it will not be saved long-term, but instead, only used to generate the outputted HTML page (audio.html) once.\n2. Multiple Users should be able to generate Horror Stories simultaneously. \n3. The app should function correctly without any issues.\n4. The currently non-scalable display in audio.html should remain the same overall, even if the format of the backend data changes.\n5. The `generateImage` function should be moved to happen in the same endpoint as `generateAudio` and `generateText` that way every time the /audio endpoint is called, a new Dalle-2 image isn't generated.\n\n# Technical Details\nTo accomplish the acceptance criteria of not saving the generated outputs (audio file, text, and image link) long-term, please use a solution that doesn't require using a 3rd party storage option. Please provide a solution that ensures that the app can generate multiple Horror Stories without saving the generated data (audio, text, and image link) long-term.\n\n# Replicating the project\n1. You will need an AWS account (ID & Secret Key) to generate the AI voice audio.\n2. You will need an OpenAI API Key to generate the outputs\n\n# Link to Project\nhttps://replit.com/@Dprevoznik/HorrorStoryGPT?v=1\n",

If a rebate program's status cannot be determined automatically, the \"manualReviewRequired\" column should contain an \"yes\".\n4. Prioritize accuracy when determining the status of a rebate program. Use \"manual review\" for any uncertain outcomes, but that should be limited to no more than 3% of rows (ideally < 1%). 99% accuracy is expected otherwise.\n5. Include proper error handling and documentation.\n\n\n# Submission\nSubmit your solution as a Replit link, with your code organized and commented as necessary. The solution should be easy to understand and run, and must meet all the requirements outlined above.\n\n# Reward\n$200 for the best solution meeting all requirements.\n\n# Deadline\nThe bounty will be open for 9 days from the date of posting.

Please stick to the existing tech stack.\n\nI will accept the following:\n\n - Users to add funds with Stripe API integration (I can help with this if needed)\n - Users to ask questions once logged in, with their funds decreasing when they ask a question\n - Users to answer questions given the GPT responses to the question\n - Users to choose if the answers meet their satisfaction\n - Users to receive funds for answering questions and to cash out once they answer the question (using Stripe Connect, which I can help with)\n\nPlease only send me the Google App Engine code that runs on your machine; I will work to upload it to my domain. I do not expect you to set up a Stripe account or test the Stripe integration; you can even skip the OpenAI integration if needed.\n\n# Technical Details\nI want to keep the app fast and straightforward to extend and maintain, so I built it in Go and Google App Engine. I will develop the front end later, so it does not need any front end development.\n\nI wrote the back end in Go, allowing me to write efficient code fast. I believe that REST works for this project, assuming that the user will continually ping the server.\n\n# Link to Project\nThe Google Drive for the project files is here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v0XZUZcmR5bsNvQFhvW3c9sO2KKHo-9A?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v0XZUZcmR5bsNvQFhvW3c9sO2KKHo-9A?usp=share_link). It has a folder \"Google App Engine Code\" for the existing back and front end code, and the \"Midjourney Sketches\" that I made to show how I want the design to look. I only want the back end finished for this project.\n\nThanks in advance! Please let me know if you have any questions.",

If you clicked a column you could resort by that column, and click again to reverse the sort order.\n\nI intend to increase the # of transactions in the database meaningfully so I decided to change my approach. I now want to use Django Pagination to show a specific number of rows on each table. I want to sort the table in the Views.py function, rather than sorting it with Javascript. \n\nUsing Ghostwriter/ChatGPT, I was able to get to an 80% solution, but it has some bugs. I want somebody to take a look at my implementation, and help coach me thru the 100% solution. I want this implemented in my web app, but equally as importantly, I want to understand how it is done.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nI want someone to spend 1-2 hours total working with my to implement pagination and sorting (ascending and descending) by column header in my Django web application. \n\nIdeally I would like someone who would be willing to jump in a Discord call or Zoom call to work on this live.

The Jokers must fit the chosen vehicle category.\nThe system compiles 32 playing cards from the chosen vehicle category, distributing them evenly among the players. Any remaining cards go to the center of the playing field, and the winner of the first round receives these cards.\nPlayers add their selected Jokers to their playing cards, and the system ensures equal card distribution at the beginning.\nThe player to the left of the dealer starts by selecting one of the following comparison categories based on #GameRules.AutoValues:\na. Year of manufacture (oldest vehicle wins)\nb. Engine/Cylinder count (highest count wins, electric drive beats cylinder count, highest number of electric drives wins)\nc. Displacement (largest displacement wins, electric drive beats displacement, highest number of electric drives wins)\nd. Power/HP (highest power wins)\ne. Top speed (highest speed wins)\nf. Acceleration from 0-100 km/h (lowest time wins)\ng. Weight in kg (lowest weight wins)\nh. List price (lowest price wins)\nIn case of a tie, all players' cards go into the \"center.\" The winner of the next round takes all the cards from the \"center.\"\nThe player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.\nIdeal User Experience (UX) Workflow:\n\nLanding Page\nVehicle Category Selection\nJoker Selection (optional, based on availability)\nGame Lobby (optional if multiplayer mode is available)\nGame Page\nResults Page (Badges multi asset NFT)\nDetailed descriptions of the individual steps of the workflow we can discuss separately with pleasure\n\nResources:\nJSON files (car examples) and AI calculation distributions for attribute selection will be provided for integration into the game.\nWhat are NFT 2.0?

For example, to get the hash you put in the bounty description, you will need to get it from https://python-selenium.nicolello.repl.co/getData?hash=0xec505c81d6a7567b5bde804870b1038832fe6da1 \n\nTo connect what I did before, you just need to do another request, it would look something like this:\nasync function fetchMarketCap(tokenAddress) {\n  let apiUrl = `https://python-selenium.walkermallory.repl.co/getData?token=${tokenAddress}`;\n  let response = await axios.get(apiUrl);\n  let data = response.data;\n  return data;\n}\nthen remember to await the function when you call it, like so:\nlet marketCap = await fetchMarketCap(\"0x87687659834756394875\"); \n\nI need this feature added: scans etherscan.io for cryptocurrencies top 300 holders and identifies wallets into 3 categories: \"Mega Whales\" with $1 million or more of USD value, \"whales\" with $100k to $999k of USD value, and \"sharks\" with $30k to $99k of USD value in holdings in wallet. \n\nThe bot will then feed back the following and show all wallets that fell into those categories (biggest wallets first in descending order): \n\nMega Whales: \n0xfdkkdkjdjhdhuue883839msmd8u3uu38 = 1,300,000 USD\n0xxkjjdjdjxjjx38738929929828 = 1,123,456 USD \n0x938737633kjfhufyuhf8383nfh87383fnc8f = 1,087,128 USD\n\n\nWhales \n0xejejndjncj484hf47hth484 = 922,574 USD\n0x838738hd773j3nfnbcbn3 = 766,365 USD\n0xnnfjerjh8u43u83hch3n8w = 653,982 USD\n0xmdjruehueuh378338dkd9 = 588,892 USD\n\nSharks\n0xmdjdnxcdkjjej389ks8 = 79,938 USD\n0x63nnd73n37djm339 = 65,930 USD\n0x73bd4nd44n22m3m = 57,893 USD\n0x74nfh4nbn547944m = 53,768 USD\n0xnbbn58383bdy3hb5 = 52,781 USD\n0xbv4m4b43km33kv4 = 37,898 USD\n\n\n\nSo final layout for the bot response should be this: \n\n\ud83d\udd35 Token name ($TRENDAI)   \n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\n\u26aa Total Supply: 10000000\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Market Cap: $100000\n\n\ud83d\udca7 Current Liquidity: 4788.764306808048168597\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Price: $0.24902188212374707\n\n\n\nAux Information\n\nCreation Time: 2023-02-02T18:13:53.052Z\n\nDeployer: 0x8458204e723762b5a2c1981679ec28b668386b3c\n\nHolders: 555\n\n\n\nTop 10 Holders \ud83d\udcc8\n\n0x9ceb11093a26e4e6fb4ef1e6f50599a37d02f515 - 4.6249%\n\n0x2a9bc620cd884eb465c0421af3b4b4a4c4993fcd - 4.2478%\n\n0x7b04ee54538c2a7136412909ef762972d471c2a1 - 4.0608%\n\n0x07f7373a623fe3eef9adacefbe1282da9be026cf - 4.0109%\n\n0x6977ec2d574d473af40836927482e99669033642 - 4.0002%\n\n0x1110a6e7e00fc94743be31157e76d1609c947ec8 - 3.9643%\n\n0x333ae9b8c9f86c84ac39c7e9ae1efcb58b6ec4bc - 3.7585%\n\n0x392824ea4c989a273054c8ed114697bc91d6a1b2 - 3.5028%\n\n0x27c878d52eeb936a7c995d7f964afdc27fdbb41a - 3.5009%\n\n0x20e09f2f8e1b6f903ff38a4af67ee49bdcd78d24 - 2.6525%\n\n\n\nContract Security \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nContract source code verified \u2705\n\nNo proxy \u2705\n\nNo Mint Function \u2705\n\nFunction found that retrieves ownership \u2705\n\nOwner can't change balance \u2705\n\nNo hidden owner \u2705\n\nThis token can not self destruct \u2705 \n\nNo external call risk found \u2705 \n\n\n\nHoneypot Risk \ud83c\udf6f\n\nBuy Tax: 0% & Sell Tax: 0% \u2705\n\nThis does not appear to be a honeypot \u2705\n\nNo codes found to suspend trading \u2705\n\nHolders can sell all of the token \u2705\n\nNo trading cooldown function \u2705\n\nUnlimited number of transactions \u2705\n\nAnti whale can not be modified \u2705\n\nTax cannot be modified \u2705\n\nNo blacklist \u2705\n\nNo whitelist \u2705\n\nNo tax changes found for personal addresses \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udc33 Mega Whales: \n0xfdkkdkjdjhdhuue883839msmd8u3uu38 = 1,300,000 USD\n0xxkjjdjdjxjjx38738929929828 = 1,123,456 USD \n0x938737633kjfhufyuhf8383nfh87383fnc8f = 1,087,128 USD\n\n\ud83d\udc0b Whales \n0xejejndjncj484hf47hth484 = 922,574 USD\n0x838738hd773j3nfnbcbn3 = 766,365 USD\n0xnnfjerjh8u43u83hch3n8w = 653,982 USD\n0xmdjruehueuh378338dkd9 = 588,892 USD\n\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks\n0xmdjdnxcdkjjej389ks8 = 79,938 USD\n0x63nnd73n37djm339 = 65,930 USD\n0x73bd4nd44n22m3m = 57,893 USD\n0x74nfh4nbn547944m = 53,768 USD\n0xnbbn58383bdy3hb5 = 52,781 USD\n0xbv4m4b43km33kv4 = 37,898 USD\n\n\n",

I should not have to run this through Replit at all, there should be a completely separate app or site/made from this. Ideally locally operate because some of this data is private.\n\nThe following is a simpler image to extract data from:\n![Image Example wtv](https://i.ibb.co/fFYqCTQ/Screenshot-20230405-212547-Gallery.png)\n\nAnd [this](https://www.mediafire.com/file/14i6vdaptmgqz7o/sample_sheet_other_format.csv/file) is how it's data should be filled on the spreadsheet. Although there is only one image, because it has multiple rows, multiple rows should be generated for it on the spreadsheet, as you can see in the linked .csv.\n\nNote that the file name is the same for each one. That is because the data is taken from the same image.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n**__This project must be completely finished by this Friday, April 7th.__** I know the Bounty has a separate date, but that was not up to me. Please have this finished ASAP. \n\nI unfortunately cannot compromise here at all. The project must be completed exactly as I described.

Company ID (Generated automatically by the system)\t\n2. Company Name \t\n3. Headquarters (Location)\t\n4. Number of Employees\t\n5. NAIC Codes\t\n6. Industry\t\n7. LinkedIn Company Profile URL\t\n8. Website URL\t\n9. Estimated Revenue\n\n# High-level Design \nThe main UI should be in a table format with the company data in each of the columns and rows.\n\nAbove the table there should be a search filtering function where users can use free form text based to search for companies. There should also be an expandable advanced search option that can apply filters based on any dimension and combination of values per each dimension.\n\n# Functionality\n1. Search function\n-Free form text search box\n-Clickable expandable advanced search functions where users can apply filters based on any dimension and combination of values per each dimension.\n\n2. Tokens system\n-Each company download costs 1 token\n-New unpaid users are awarded 10,000 tokens. They are replenished monthly, but a free user will never exceed 10,000 tokens unless they contribute back to the data set. Each record/data value within an existing company record updated results in 1 token. Each company record that is added results in 8 tokens.\n-Users who do not wish to contribute back to the data set can purchase tokens. $10 per thousand tokens.\n\n3. CSV Import/Export\n-Ability for users to upload records in bulk for token rewards\n-Ability for users to apply filters and export companies consuming tokens.\n\n4. Import Review System\n-System that can keep track of all the uploads \n-Any automations we can run to validate records are accurate\n-Ability to identify duplicate records  \n-Need a system to review requested changes and approve or deny them.\n\n5.

You can do that first and send me a copy of the code if you want, here is the link to that bounty\nhttps://replit.com/bounties/@neovike/create-a-discord-scr#problem-description\n\n## Problem Description\nI need an active dataset extract and storage solution of chats from many different discord servers. I need this data to be no more stale than 3 hours. I need to monitor around 20 different discord servers. Some of these servers will have very few people in them (less than 100), and some of them will have more than 50k active users.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Must written in python or C++\n- Must scrape the complete history of a server, for all channels.\n- You may use a different tool to build the history from the one that is used to keep the dataset up to date. Feel free to use a tool like https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter\n- Must be no more stale than 3 hour\n- Must store the data in a GCS bucket or BigQuery table or S3 or PostgreSQL. I am fine paying for GCS/BQ/S3 storage and am fine paying for the write costs (you can send me some estimates). \n- If you are storing data in GCS then you should use compressed JSON or some structured format. CSV is not acceptable.\n- Must use a single consistent schema. This schema should be shared with me along with a description of the fields you are using.\n- Must not have gaps in data.\n- It's acceptable to have some minimal overlap in data, but no more than 5% of data should be duplicated.\n- Must provide a way to run this pipeline to keep the datasets up to date. Options that come to mind are GitHub Actions with a cron job, but I am open to alternatives.\n- I only have a single Discord account. I can't be asked to bring many discord accounts in order to make this system work\n- It's not acceptable for me to pay a SaaS service (or another type of service) to do this scraping.\n- The system must run reliably. Occasionally, you can hit over rate limits.\n- You should print out descriptive logs to the console as you are scraping channels/servers\n\n## How will I test your submission?\n- I can provide you with a file on GitHub containing a list of servers.\n- Your system should pick up this file and automatically start scraping Discord for these servers\n- I will then go to one of the channels in one of the servers, and post a message.\n- I will then make sure that the message is visible in the dataset you are producing 1 hour later.\n- I will also randomly sample messages from servers to see if they are in your dataset\n\n## Important\n- I will only consider proposals that provide a high-level detailed plan for how you will implement this pipeline. You should talk about how you will backfill the discord channel data, how you will keep it up to date (and save computing time), how this pipeline will be run regularly to meet the freshness requirements, how you will ensure you don't have overlapping data or gaps in the data, how you will deal with rate limits of the discord API, etc.\n\n*Thank you neovike if you are reading this. I copied your problem description because you can describe way better than what I wrote in my original bounty. ",

        "description": "(Note to previous applicants -- I have updated the bounty since it was first posted!)\n\n**Problem Description**\n\nI want to build a simple clone of the game Blaseball, where a \"game\" or series of \"games\" are simulated, stats are tracked and aggregated, and different configurations of teams and players exist. This is intended to be a prototype for early tweaking, balancing, and user testing.\n\nThis clone is intended to apply the basic concept of the Blaseball simulation to the sport of basketball. Another potentially helpful comparison is to BasketballGM.\n\nI am only interested in creating a prototype of the __simulation__ part of Blaseball -- we will ignore all features related to placing bets, purchasing consumable items, or voting.\n\nThere are two key aspects to this prototype: \n1) The ability to **simulate games and aggregate the statistics that result** from these games. This simulation should be well-documented, so that I can go in and adjust the way the simulation operates on my own. \n2) The ability to **manage and manipulate a database** of players, teams, and game results. Ideally, this data is stored in a format compatible with SQL queries so that I can do my own analysis.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria - Simulation**\n\nAs a user, I can simulate multiple \"games\" simultaneously with a button click (e.g. \"Simulate one game\", \"Simulate 10x games\", \"Simulate 100x games\", etc.). \n\nAs a user, the code for the simulation is well-documented so that I can go in and adjust the simulation myself (e.g. change how a given player-vs.-player outcome is determined)\n\nAny given \"game\" simulation should do the following:\n\nPull in player and team data from the user-editable dataset and utilize that data in the simulation.\n\nSimulate \"game\" outcomes on a turn-by-turn basis. For example, let's say that each \"game\" consists of 10 turns and each turn matches a given player from Team A against a given player from Team B. Every turn should result in some game outcome (e.g. +2 points to Team A, +3 points to Team B, etc.), as well as some statistical outcome (e.g. +2 points for Player X, +3 points for Player Y, etc.)\n\nTrack and aggregate player and team statistics at the conclusion of each \"game\", such that a user can see the results of an individual game, as well as the results of all games at an aggregate level. \n\n**Acceptance Criteria - Database**\nAs a user, I can view the results of each simulation so that I can easily understand how the simulation is performing and where tweaks need to be made. \nAs a user, I can add new types of data to reflect different statistics or characteristics that I might want to incorporate into the simulation (e.g. \"Points\", \"Rebounds\", \"Strength\", \"3pt Shooting\", etc.)As a user, I can create a new player to be incorporated into the database and simulations. Player creation should have the option for either random (random name, random stats, random team assignment, etc.) or for manual creation (manually type name, manually set stats, etc.).\n\n--\n\nThere is potential for this bounty to evolve into future bounties for the right partner.\u00a0 I am a product manager in the games industry by training, and have experience working directly with engineers. Once the bounty is accepted, we can further discuss the details of implementation and how it should all work.\u00a0",

However, I would prefer to build the 'services' described above. \n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nA. Two new Home Assistant services:\n1. 'user_access_control.activate_user' - takes a 'username' as an input and then activates that user. \n2. 'user_access_control.deactivate_user' - takes a 'username' as an input and then deactivates that user. \nIt might be that Home Assistant requires a 'user_id' and not a 'username'. If this is the case, it would be great if you could build a template that shows 'user_id' and 'username' next to each other so it's easier for me to find 'user_id'. I could display the template in the UI somewhere. \n\nB. These services need to show up in the 'Developer Tools>Services' UI and the Automation Builder UI. I think the services have to register or be loaded correctly. I got this to work, but struggled to get the code correct. \n\nC. When the user is activated/deactivated using these services, the correct state needs to show in the standard 'Users' UI. I imagine this will happen automatically, but want to add this to be sure. \n\nD. Decent logging so that I can troubleshoot if this ever doesn't work.\n\nThe deliverable can essentially be the folders and files that I need to add to the 'custom_components' directory. \n\n# Technical Details\nMostly Python. Developer docs for building a service (a type of \"custom component\") in Home Assistant - https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_component_index\n\n# Link to Project\n",

The relevant configuration variables are as follows:\n\n```ini\n### nbdev ###\nlib_path = lewinb\nnbs_path = nbs\n```\nIn this case, this means the python module will be located in `./lewinb` and the notebooks are stored in `./nbs`.\n\nThe goal is to create a vscode extension to help you navigate between code in the notebooks and python modules.  I have already made significant progress towards this but got stuck.\n\nI explain more [in this 5 minute video](https://www.loom.com/share/96757265bf8340a0a5e411bc86a7f90c) - please watch this video as it is much easier to understand the problem this way.\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Have to be able to navigate to the specific cell in a notebook from a python module, not just the notebook\n- Implement the ability to go in the reverse direction: notebook -> source file\n- Add at least one simple test\n\n# Links\n\n1.

Shows current day as \u2018selected\u2019 state, showing 7 days at a time\n    2. Shows upcoming days to the right\n    3. Days have a icon badge beneath the number to represent event type happening that day\n    4. Can only view days in the future, not in the past\n2. `AgendaViewer`\n    1. Shows events per day (see EventItem)\n    2. Scrollable, shows up to 7 upcoming days, but keeps lazy loading more days as you scroll down\n    3. When scrolling, the currently viewed day agenda is also the selected day in the Day selector up top (see [video example](https://imgur.com/a/u5A2A2j))\n    4. The user can scroll to months in the future and the agenda and the Day selector stay in sync\n3. `EventItem` - show instance times\n    A. If event upcoming (not happened yet): Show event start time\n    B. If event happening now: Show event start time & event ending time \n    C. If event passed: Show event ended time with ~~strikethrough~~\n    D. Event item should contain an icon with a link to the infographic URL\n\n[Mockup and examples screenshots shown here](https://imgur.com/a/u5A2A2j)\n\n- There should be no use of jQuery or outdated libraries. \n- There should be good use of flex components to adapt to various screen sizes\n- The components should be properly built and independent to allow for easy to update styles\n\n# User journey:\n- Page gracefully loads without glitches or content reflowing\n- User sees current days events\n- User sees time information based on their date/time\n- User taps on a day in the header area, and the list scrolls to the that day\n- The user scrolls up and down the agenda list and the Day selector changes state to show selected day",

The widget needs a variety of functionalities (listed below) that can easily be toggled on or off in real time as I use the widget to tutor students. \n\nIteration likely required. \n \n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nHere is an example of what the widget can look like:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ihd35u1zjIcpZaKqn491WUrZ8rogzKSO/preview\n\n The image should clarify some of the requests below. Please reach out if you have questions.\n\nThe widget should have the following functionalities and the ability to easily change these / turn these off or on:\n- Different base number systems (base 2, base 3, base 4, etc. all the way to base 12) - Ability to change the base from a dropdown (student can change this but I can also hide this ability)\n- Display 2-6 columns with the ability to add and hide columns\n- Tokens (or dots) that represent the values in each column\n- The ability to add or remove tokens from a column( +/-  can be turned off or on by column)\n- A refresh button that clears the columns\n- The ability to drag and drop tokens across columns\n- Labeling each token with the column's place value (for example, in base two, the columns and its token(s) should be labeled 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.)\n- Displaying the number of tokens in a column above the column\n- Displaying the total value of tokens in a column below the column\n- Displaying the total summation of all columns at the bottom\n- Column can be capped at N-1 tokens (n = base)\n- Tokens in a column can exceed cap and then a visual indicator will appear when the number of tokens is >= N. This indicator should make the dots jiggle, as well as changing the color of the border of the column. \n- Ability to highlight columns\n- Ability to reverse column order\n- Labels for each column according to the base\n- Assigned color for each column; tokens within a column match this color\n- Ability to easily configure settings in a Widget playground and to save and call upon the widget in a certain settings config; ability to toggle the settings in real time in a 1on1 tutoring environment\n- Stacking Visualization - When moving to a column to the left (higher power), tokens display a stacking animation upon drag and hover of the left-hand column. This shows that you are not just bringing one token, but that you are dragging 5 ones tokens and regrouping into 1 five token (in Base 5).  This should only happen when you have the requisite tokens in the right-hand column (N tokens, where n is the base system) Image example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7FNUn1298HCfXcB5V-NqUXNVFuEzY8B/preview\n- A \u201cworking backwards and forwards\u201d constraint where you can only drag to the left or the right while certain conditions are met\n- Pointers: Some visual indicator to direct students on tasks (e.g. finger pointers to indicate columns)\n- Audio feedback when tokens are dragged to new columns. \"Popping\" sound.\n\n",
